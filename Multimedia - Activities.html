<p>
    I left work for lunch walking to a restaurant just 2 blocks away.
    As I rounded the corner a car accident happens right in front of me. A lady walking just 10 feet in front of me
    is hit and pinned between the car and a building. She was conscious and mad as hell.
    Despite her legs being obviously broken she let loose a stream of verbal abuse on the driver about her shoes,
    her dress, her phone, everything except her injuries. It was surreal.
